# Nutrition Analysis Using Image Classification

# Description :
In the current age, people are more conscious about their food and diet to avoid either upcoming or existing diseases.In order to properly assess dietary intake, accurate estimation of calorie value of food is of paramount importance.Due to the advances in various technologies used in smart phones, their computational power has also increased.They are capable of processing real-time multi-media information with their computational power. Since the present smart phones can handle the high-quality images too, research on food classification is focused on developing real-time applications which capture images and train the machine learning models instantly.It helps to take prevention to avoid diseases such as diabetes, blood pressure and so on.

# Solution :
Here effort has been made to classify the images of food for further diet monitoring applications using convolution neural networks (CNNs). Since the CNNs are capable of handling a large amount of data and can estimate the features automatically, they have been utilised for the task of food classification. The standard Fruits dataset has been  selected as the working database for this approach. After the classification is done a Nutrition API is called to get the calorie count and protein content. A Web application is built and CNN model is deployed to use this application.
