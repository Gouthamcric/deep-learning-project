In the current age, people are more conscious about their food and diet to avoid either upcoming or existing diseases.In order to properly assess dietary intake, accurate estimation of calorie value of food is of paramount importance.Due to the advances in various technologies used in smart phones, their computational power has also increased.They are capable of processing real-time multi-media information with their computational power. Since the present smart phones can handle the high-quality images too, research on food classification is focused on developing real-time applications which capture images and train the machine learning models instantly.It helps to take prevention to avoid diseases such as diabetes, blood pressure and so on.
